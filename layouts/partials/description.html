            I’m a design-minded front-end developer. Sometimes people who do what I do are also called front-end designers, UI developers, UI engineers, or design engineers.
            That is, <strong>my work lies at the intersection of design and back-end</strong>. I write HTML, CSS, SVG, and presentational JavaScript that powers Web user interfaces. With a <strong>focus on responsive design, semantic markup, and performance</strong>. I build <strong>resilient, inclusive foundations for user interfaces</strong>, marrying cutting-edge techniques with foundational Web standards.
            I collaborate with designers — preferrably in the design phase — to <strong>translate designs into live prototypes</strong>, resilient Web user interfaces, and design systems. As a design engineer, <strong>I provide feedback to designers to ensure that the design translates well to the browser</strong>, ensuring usability of the product by as many people as possible, regardless of their context and how they use it.
