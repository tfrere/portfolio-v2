  <!-- Native and web experience, this project aims to explore different ways of searching for images in the latent space generated by the training of a G.A.N.
  The experience is played with both controller and keyboard, and there is a web version and a native OSX application version.

  A G.A.N. (Generative Adversorial Network) is a generative model where two networks are presented competing in a game theory scenario. The first network is the generator, a sample is produced (here, an image), while its opponent, the discriminator, tries to detect if a sample is real or if it is the result of the generator. Learning can be modeled as a zero-sum game.

  ## Case study
