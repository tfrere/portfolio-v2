description: Get color meanings from all around the world !
---

This project started with the need to dig into the data visualization made by David McCandless a few years ago.
It was for the first time embodied by a javascript library (available on npm). Then by a single page app that allows you to sort information in different ways.

Get cultural meanings from all around the world. Based on the excellent work of David McCandless.
