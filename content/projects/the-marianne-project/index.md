**New technologies** make it possible to analyze a large number of images and train an artificial intelligence to create a new example from these images.

This artistic project aims to collect images of French women, and to ask AI to create the French woman representative of all of these women, in their diversity as well as in their consistency. The result will not look like any of the photos collected, but the AI ​​will have used each photo for the realization of the final work.

We wish to propose the work as a candidate to be printed on the next editions of postage stamps. We also wish to offer a physical copy to the President of the Republic.
