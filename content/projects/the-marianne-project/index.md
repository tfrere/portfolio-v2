**New technologies** make it possible to analyze a **large number of images** and train an **artificial intelligence** to create a new example from these images.

This artistic project aims to **collect images of French women**, and **to ask AI to create the French woman representative of all of these women**, in their diversity as well as in their consistency. **The result will not look like any of the photos collected**, but the AI ​​will have used each photo for the realization of the final work.

We wish to propose the work as a candidate to be printed on the next editions of postage stamps. We also wish to offer a physical copy to the **President of the Republic**.

<!-- They are behind the sale of the first AI artwork to go through a major auction house. They use their work to share their vision of artificial intelligence and its implementation in our society. They are working with enterprises such as LVMH, Cité des sciences, Quai Branly, Nike, Christie's -->
