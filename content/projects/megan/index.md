La Fémis (Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Métiers de l'Image et du Son) is a large public school belonging to the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, located in the heart of Paris. Since the institution’s inception, La Fémis has been committed to training students on the various disciplines of film: directing, cinematography, producing, screenwriting, editing, sound production, production design, continuity, distribution, and cinema management. Each year, the school produces more than 250 short films, dramas, and documentaries. More than just mere exercises, these films are often true masterpieces that herald the next generation of filmmakers. In order to preserve the experimental nature of these pieces, only some of the films are actually broadcasted outside of the school. Only the second-year documentaries, the third-year films, and the final thesis projects were able to obtain broadcasting rights.
